                <p class="criteria-header">ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA</p>
                <p>(i)<br>
                  For admission to any of the First Degree programmes of BITS except B.Pharm.:  Candidates should have passed the 12th examination of 10+2 system from a recognized Central or State board or its equivalent with Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics (PCM) and adequate proficiency in English.
                </p>
                <p>(ii)<br>

                </p>
                <p class="criteria-header">Admission to all the programmes is subject to the conditions given below:</p>
                <p>
                  The candidate should have obtained a minimum of aggregate 75% marks in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics subjects (if he/she has taken Mathematics in BITSAT) or a minimum of aggregate 75% marks in Physics, Chemistry and Biology subjects (if he/she has taken Biology in BITSAT) subjects in 12th examination, with at least 60% marks in each of the Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics / Biology subjects.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Only Students who are appearing for 12th class examination in 2023 or who have passed 12th class Examination in 2022 are eligible to appear in the BITSAT-2023 test. If a candidate has taken more than one attempt in 12th class or its equivalent, only his/her latest performance is considered, provided this attempt has been for the full component of subjects/courses prescribed. Students who have passed 12th examination in 2021 or earlier are NOT eligible to appear in BITSAT-2023. Students who are presently studying in BITS at any of its campuses are not eligible to appear in BITSAT-2023.

                <p>
                  Admissions will be made purely on merit. The merit position of the candidate for admission will be based on the score obtained by the candidate in the BITSAT-2023. For a candidate who has appeared twice in BITSAT 2023, and then seeks admission to any of the First Degree programmes in BITS Pilani, the higher of the two scores will be considered for admission. However, their eligibility for admission is subject to fulfilling the requirement of minimum marks in 12th examination, as mentioned above.
